# Step 5: Let's write tests for the Async Events

Now that we address the REST/Synchronous part, let's have a look on the part related to Asynchronous Kafka events. Testing of asynchronous or event-driven system is usually a pain for developers 🥲

## First Test - Verify our OrderService is publishing events

## Second Test - Verify our OrderEventListener is processing events

## Wrap-up

Thanks a lot for being through this quite long demonstration. We hope you learned new techniques for integration tests with both REST and Async/Event-driven APIs. Cheers! 🍻
