# Step 2: Exploring the app

This fictional application we're working on is a typical `Order Service` that can allow online, physical stores, or even
partners to place orders for our fresh-backed pastries! For that, the `Order Service` is exposing a REST API to its consumers
but also relies on an existing API we have [introduced in a previous post](https://medium.com/@lbroudoux/different-levels-of-api-contract-testing-with-microcks-ccc0847f8c97) ðŸ˜‰

![Order Service ecosystem](./assets/order-service-ecosystem.png)

The `Order Service` application has been designed around 5 main components that are directly mapped on Spring Boot components and classes:
* The [`OrderController`](internal/controller/order_controller.go) (in package `controller`) is responsible for exposing an `Order API` to the outer world.
* The [`OrderService`](internal/service/order_service.go) is responsible for implementing the business logic around the creation of orders.
* The [`PastryAPIClient`](internal/client/pastry_api.go) is responsible for calling the `Pastry API` in *Product Domain* and get details or list of pastries.
* The [`OrderEventPublisher`](internal/service/order_event_publisher.go) is responsible for publishing a message on a `Kafka` topic when a new `Order` is created.
* The [`OrderEventListener`](internal/service/order_event_listener.go) is responsible for consuming message on a `Kafka` topic when an `Order` has been reviewed.

![Order Service architecture](./assets/order-service-architecture.png)

Of course, this is a very naive vision of a real-life system as such an application would certainly pull out much more
dependencies (like a `Payment Service`, a `Customer Service`, a `Shipping Service`, and much more) and offer more complex API.


However, this situation is complex enough to highlight the two problems we're addressing:
1) How to **efficiently set up a development environment** that depends on third-party API like the Pastry API?
   - You certainly want to avoid cloning this component repository and trying to figure out how to launch and configure it accordingly.
   - As a developer, developing your own mock of this service makes you also lose time and risk drifting from initial intent,
2) How to **efficiently validate the conformance** of the `Order API` and `Order Events` against business expectations and API contracts?
   - Besides the core business logic, you might want to validate the network and protocol serialization layers as well as the respect of semantics.

## Business logic

This application must implement basic flows:
* When creating a new [`Order`](internal/model/order.go), the service must check that the products are available before creating and persisting an order. Otherwise, order cannot be placed.
* When the [`Order`](internal/model/order.go) is actually created, the service must also publish an [`OrderEvent`](internal/model/order.go) to a specific Kafka topic to propagate this information to other systems that will review the events,
* When the [`OrderEvent`](internal/model/order.go) has been reviewed, a new message is published on another `Kafka` topic. The [`OrderEventListener`](internal/service/order_event_listener.go) must capture-it and update the corresponding [`Order`](internal/model/order.go) status using the service. 

## Flows specifications

All the interactions are specified using API contracts:
* The Order API is specified using the [`order-service-openapi.yaml`](testdata/order-service-openapi.yaml) OpenAPI specification,
* The Pastry API is specified using the [`apipastries-openapi.yaml`](testdata/apipastries-openapi.yaml) OpenAPI specification,
* The Order Events are specified using the [`order-events-asyncapi.yaml`](testdata/order-events-asyncapi.yaml) AsyncAPI specification.

Those specifications will help us for two things:
1) They will be used to provide simulations (or mocks) of third-parties systems - typically the Pastry API provider and the reviewer system that provides updates on `OrderEvents`
2) They will be used to allow checking the conformance of the provided `Order API` and the published `Order Event` on order creation.
